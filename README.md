# M3PaperMQTTOctoPrint
Program M5Paper with MQTT for Octoprint 3D Print Server in UIFlow.
In the previous video we used the UI designer in UIFlow to arrange rectangles and labels on the M5Paper eInk screen. Then we used MQTT monitor the temperature in my office. In this video, let's go further with MQTT on M5Paper to monitor the status of my Creality Ender-3 3D printer using the MQTT plugin in Octoprint.
